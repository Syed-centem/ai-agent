🌌 Knowledge Base Agent

📌 Project Overview

Category: Business Operations (Knowledge Base Agent)

The Knowledge Base Agent (codenamed Gemini Neural Hub) is a next-generation AI assistant designed to act as a secure, intelligent "Second Brain" for enterprise data. Unlike traditional keyword search tools, it utilizes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) powered by Google's advanced Gemini 1.5/2.5 models to read, understand, and reason across entire PDF documents instantly.

This project features a unique "Smart Model Switcher" engine that automatically routes queries to the optimal Google model (Flash, Pro, or Legacy) to ensure 100% uptime and zero 404 errors, wrapped in a stunning Cyberpunk/Sci-Fi interface.

🚀 Key Features

🧠 Smart Brain Engine

Auto-Failover: Automatically detects API errors (404/429) and switches between gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro, and gemini-2.0 models instantly.

Context-Aware: Injects full document context into the system prompt for high-fidelity answers.

🎨 Cyberpunk HUD Interface

Immersive Design: Features animated particle backgrounds, glassmorphism panels, and neon typography.

Interactive Feedback: Visual and simulated auditory cues (toast notifications) for system status.

🖼️ Auto-Diagramming

Visual Thinking: Intelligently detects requests for "structures", "flows", or "processes" and automatically generates Graphviz/DOT diagrams to visualize the data.

📊 Live Telemetry

Real-Time Stats: A sidebar dashboard showing page counts, character volume, and simulated network latency.

🛡️ Enterprise Security

Ephemeral Processing: API Keys and Document data are processed in-memory and cleared upon session reset. Zero permanent storage.

🏗️ Architecture

Ingestion Layer: User uploads a PDF. The Streamlit app uses pypdf to extract raw text and metadata.

Context Injection: The extracted text is optimized and injected into the System Prompt of the GeminiAgent.

Smart Routing Layer: The GeminiBrain attempts connection with the priority model (Flash). If a 404 or connection error occurs, it seamlessly fails over to Pro or Legacy models in real-time.

Generation Layer: The active Gemini model generates a markdown response. It decides whether to output text or graphviz code based on the query.

Rendering Layer: The Frontend renders the markdown text and compiles any DOT code into visible diagrams instantly.
