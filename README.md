🌌 Knowledge Base Agent - Gemini Powered📌 Project OverviewSubmitted for: Rooman AI Agent Development ChallengeCategory: Business Operations (Knowledge Base Agent)This Knowledge Base Agent serves as a secure, intelligent "Second Brain" for enterprise data. Unlike traditional search tools, it uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) powered by Google's Gemini 1.5/2.5 models to read, understand, and reason across entire PDF documents instantly.It features a "Smart Model Switcher" that automatically routes queries to the best available Google model (Flash, Pro, or 2.0) to ensure 100% uptime and zero 404 errors.🚀 Key Features🧠 Smart Brain Engine: Automatically detects and switches between gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro, and gemini-2.0 models if one fails or is region-locked.🎨 Cyberpunk HUD Interface: A fully immersive, ultra-futuristic UI with animated backgrounds, glassmorphism panels, and simulated neural processing visuals.🖼️ Auto-Diagramming: Intelligently detects requests for structural explanations and generates Graphviz/DOT diagrams instantly.📊 Live Telemetry: Real-time dashboard showing page count, character volume, and simulated latency metrics.🛡️ Enterprise Security: API Keys and Documents are processed in ephemeral session memory and never stored permanently.🛠️ Tech StackFrontend: Streamlit (Python) with Custom CSS/JS Injection.AI Core: Google Gemini API (v1beta).Data Processing: pypdf for vectorization-ready text extraction.Visualization: Graphviz for structural data rendering.⚙️ Setup & Run InstructionsClone the Repository:git clone [YOUR_REPO_LINK_HERE]
cd [YOUR_REPO_NAME]
Install Dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Agent:streamlit run app.py
Initialize:Enter your Google Gemini API Key in the secure sidebar.Upload a PDF document.Click "INITIATE NEURAL LINK".🏗️ ArchitectureIngestion: User uploads PDF -> System extracts text via pypdf.Context Windowing: Text is optimized and injected into the System Prompt.Smart Routing: The GeminiBrain attempts connection with the fastest model (Flash). If a 404/Error occurs, it seamlessly fails over to Pro or Legacy models.Generation: The AI generates a markdown response (text or Graphviz code).Rendering: The Frontend renders the text and compiles any diagrams into images.🔮 Future ImprovementsVoice Mode: Adding Speech-to-Text for voice commands.Multi-Doc Support: Analyzing multiple PDFs simultaneously.Persistent Vector DB: Integrating ChromaDB for datasets larger than 2M tokens.
